# Data Analytics for Banker Series, Credit Risk, and Election Analysis

Welcome to the Data Analytics for Banker Series, Credit Risk, and Election Analysis project! This repository is a dynamic space for learning, exploring, and improving your data analytics skills.:)

## About the Project

This project is a simple project that im currently interested in, it may not be the brightest project out there. But it may be helpful to some of you guys who just start some Data Analytics project for the first time.

My project consists of three main components:

1. **Banker Series Analysis**: Dive into the financial world with data analytics for banking and finance professionals. Understand market trends, portfolio performance, and risk assessment through data-driven insights.

2. **Credit Risk Assessment**: Learn the ins and outs of credit risk analysis. try to explore credit scoring, default prediction, and strategies for minimizing financial risks.

3. **Election Analysis**: Stay up-to-date with election analysis, especially in US. Particularly relevant in the current political climate. Im trying to analyze voter sentiment based on tweets, debates.

I will try to improve my current project so it'll stay relevant and also not just about these three main topics.
